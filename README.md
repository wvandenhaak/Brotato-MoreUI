## Features 
Mod settings are available under Options on the main menu of the game.
- Enable "What's new Mode" to only show Stats that received an Update in the current wave.
- Enable "Show Stat difference from Wave-Start" to show how much your Stats have changed in a wave
- Enable "Align UI right" to move the UI to the right side of the Screen - Should be compatible with otDan's WaveTimer
- Enable "Living Trees and (min - max) of Possible Spawns" to display how many Trees are currenty on the Map and how many trees can spawn at least or at most.

The Mod is now compatible with Monos' Revamped Icons - Credit for the Icons goes to Mono and a big thanks for letting me use them in MoreUI. To use the Icons you have to subscribe to his Mod and enable the Icons in the Options of MoreUI
